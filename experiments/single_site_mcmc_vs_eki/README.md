# Single-site calibration: MCMC against EKI

Calibrate SIPNET at one site, Harvard Forest by default, to observed NEE and
the pool constraints, and compare the posterior an MCMC sampler finds with the
one EKI finds. `config.py` is the one source of truth; nothing else here makes
a choice.

## Files

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | every choice, in sections: the site, paths, the drivers, the model (SIPNET's process flags), running SIPNET (timeout, staging, workers), and the observations (NEE windows, pool constraints, sources left out, operators) |
| `prepare_drivers.py` | writes the site's driver file, corrected for four known defects of the ERA5 driver files, to `output/drivers/`, which the runs read; its docstring says what each defect is and how it is corrected |
| `inputs.py` | one loader per data source, restricted to the site; run it to check that every input is found |
| `operators.py` | the two observation operators the library does not have: a mean rate over each window (NEE), and dry aboveground biomass from wood carbon (LandTrendr) |
| `observations.py` | the observed values of every observation source, prepared from `inputs` as `config` says, and the calibration and validation observation vectors; run it to see what each holds |
| `output/` | everything the experiment writes; untracked |

## Running it

From the repository root, in an environment synced as `CLAUDE.md` describes,
with the site's driver directories under `data/raw/drivers/` and the
processed files built (`scripts/ingest_*.py`):

```bash
uv run python experiments/single_site_mcmc_vs_eki/prepare_drivers.py
uv run python experiments/single_site_mcmc_vs_eki/inputs.py
uv run python experiments/single_site_mcmc_vs_eki/observations.py
```

## The observation model

The calibration conditions on a vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^N$ through

$$
y = \mathcal{H}\big(\mathcal{M}(\theta)\big) + \varepsilon, \qquad \varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, R),
$$

where $\mathcal{M}(\theta)$ is one SIPNET run over the prepared drivers at
parameters $\theta$, $\mathcal{H}$ stacks the observation operators of the
$K = 5$ observation sources below, and $R$ is the noise covariance. $y$, its
order (site-major, then source in the order below, then time) and the
operators are `observations.calibration_observation_vector()`; each operator
is bound to its source in `config.OBSERVATION_OPERATORS`. This section states
each source's data, its operator and its measurement error exactly; the noise
model assembling $R$ follows, as a proposal.

### Notation

The model runs on three-hourly timesteps $s = 1, \dots, S$ covering the
intervals $(a_s, b_s]$ in UTC, of length $\Delta_s = b_s - a_s$ (in days), as
pySIPNET's `timestep_start` and `time` give them. The record is
$(a_1, b_S] = $ (2011-12-31 21:00, 2024-12-31 21:00]. SIPNET reports two kinds
of output variable:

- a **per-step total** $F_s$ over $(a_s, b_s]$, such as net ecosystem exchange
  $\mathrm{NEE}_s$ in g C m⁻² per step (`timestep_total`);
- a **state** $X_s$ at the end of the step $b_s$, such as a carbon pool in
  g C m⁻² (`timestep_end_state`).

A **window** is an interval $W = (w^-, w^+]$. The model steps a window reduces
over are those whose end falls inside it, $S(W) = \{s : b_s \in W\}$; every
window below has its edges on step edges, so these steps tile it exactly. The
step-length-weighted mean of a quantity $Z$ over a window is

$$
\langle Z \rangle_W = \frac{\sum_{s \in S(W)} Z_s \, \Delta_s}{\sum_{s \in S(W)} \Delta_s}.
$$

For an observation labeled at a time $t$, $s(t)$ is the step containing it,
$a_{s(t)} < t \le b_{s(t)}$.

### NEE: `nee_night_centered` and `nee_day_centered`

**Data.** The hourly series `ameriflux_nee_hourly_ustar_variable` of US-Ha1
(AmeriFlux FLUXNET FULLSET `NEE_VUT_REF`, the gap-filled NEE with the u\*
threshold estimated per year), in µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹, positive to the
atmosphere. Hour $h$ is the mean rate $\mathrm{NEE}^{\mathrm{obs}}_h$ over
$(h - 1\,\mathrm{h}, h]$ UTC, with quality flag $q_h$ (`NEE_VUT_REF_QC`: 0
measured, 1-3 gap-filled by marginal distribution sampling of decreasing
quality).

**Windows.** Each UTC day $d$ of the calibration years 2012-2020 gives two
windows, $W^{\mathrm{night}}_d = (d, d + 12\,\mathrm{h}]$ and
$W^{\mathrm{day}}_d = (d + 12\,\mathrm{h}, d + 24\,\mathrm{h}]$
(`config.NEE_WINDOWS`). Each holds $n_W = 12$ hours
$H(W) = \{h : (h - 1\,\mathrm{h}, h] \subset W\}$.

**Observation.** Window $W$ is an observation if and only if at least half its
hours were measured (`config.NEE_MINIMUM_MEASURED_FRACTION`),

$$
\frac{1}{n_W} \sum_{h \in H(W)} \mathbf{1}[q_h = 0] \;\ge\; 0.5,
$$

and its value is the mean of all its hours, measured and gap-filled,

$$
y_W = \frac{1}{n_W} \sum_{h \in H(W)} \mathrm{NEE}^{\mathrm{obs}}_h .
$$

It is labeled with the window's end $w^+$ and carries the window.

**Operator** (`operators.AverageRateOverWindows("net_ecosystem_exchange")`).
The per-step total divided by the step length is a rate in g C m⁻² d⁻¹,
averaged over the window and converted:

$$
\mathcal{H}_W(\mathcal{M}) = c \left\langle \frac{\mathrm{NEE}}{\Delta} \right\rangle_W
= c \, \frac{\sum_{s \in S(W)} \mathrm{NEE}_s}{w^+ - w^-},
\qquad
c = \frac{10^6}{M_{\mathrm{C}} \cdot 86400} \approx 0.96362,
$$

with $M_{\mathrm{C}} = 12.011$ g mol⁻¹, turning g C m⁻² d⁻¹ into
µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹ (one mole of CO₂ per mole of C). The conversion is the
observation vector's, through `pysipnet.units`. Here $S(W)$ is four steps.

### MODIS leaf area index: `modis_leaf_area_index`

**Data.** MCD15A3H v061 4-day composites at the site, June-August only, with
the product's flagged retrievals dropped at ingest (`sd > 20`, which is
exactly the `qc == "001"` flag). Composite $i$ has leaf area index $y_i$
(m² m⁻²), standard deviation $\sigma_i$, and a date label $t_i$ at 00:00 UTC;
whether the label is the composite's first day is unconfirmed
(`data/README.md` open question 23).

**Observation.** $y_i$ for every composite with $a_1 < t_i \le b_S$, which
drops the 2011 composites.

**Operator** (the library's `ComputeLeafAreaIndex`, SIPNET's own
`plantLeafC / leafCSpWt`). Leaf carbon at the end of the step containing the
label, over the run's leaf carbon per area $\lambda$ (SIPNET's `leafCSpWt`,
g C per m² of leaf, a parameter):

$$
\mathcal{H}_i(\mathcal{M}) = \frac{C^{\mathrm{leaf}}_{s(t_i)}}{\lambda}.
$$

A label at 00:00 falls in the step ending then, so this is the leaf carbon at
the label itself.

### LandTrendr biomass: `landtrendr_aboveground_biomass`

**Data.** LandTrendr's annual aboveground biomass at the site, `agb_mean` in
Mg ha⁻¹, with its `agb_sd`, for the years 2012-2017
(`config.LANDTRENDR_YEARS`). Year $j$ carries the window
$W_j = (\text{1 January } j, \text{1 January } j+1]$.

**Observation.** $y_j$, taken as **dry biomass**, not carbon (its processed
file records carbon; the reasons are under Decisions).

**Operator** (`operators.ComputeAbovegroundBiomass(0.48)`). Wood carbon, a
state, averaged over the year and divided by the carbon fraction of dry wood
$f_{\mathrm{C}} = 0.48$ (`config.WOOD_CARBON_FRACTION`), converted from
g m⁻² to Mg ha⁻¹:

$$
\mathcal{H}_j(\mathcal{M}) = 10^{-2} \, \frac{\langle C^{\mathrm{wood}} \rangle_{W_j}}{f_{\mathrm{C}}}.
$$

$C^{\mathrm{wood}}$ is SIPNET's `plantWoodC`, its aboveground wood; coarse and
fine roots are pools of their own, and leaves are not counted.

### SoilGrids soil carbon: `soilgrids_soil_organic_carbon`

**Data.** One static value $y$, the SoilGrids soil organic carbon stock over
0-200 cm in Mg C ha⁻¹, with its `sd`.

**Operator** (the library's `ReduceOverRun("soil_carbon", how="mean")`). The
soil carbon pool averaged over the whole run, converted from g C m⁻² to
Mg C ha⁻¹:

$$
\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{M}) = 10^{-2} \, \langle C^{\mathrm{soil}} \rangle_{(a_1, b_S]} .
$$

With the litter pool off (`config.MODEL_FLAGS`), litter goes straight into
$C^{\mathrm{soil}}$.

### Measurement error

What each source's data say about their own error, and nothing more. Each is
a standard deviation per observation; how they are combined, correlated and
added to is the noise model below.

- **NEE.** Two hourly columns of the FULLSET file, both in µmol m⁻² s⁻¹:
  the random uncertainty $r_h$ (`NEE_VUT_REF_RANDUNC`, estimated from the
  measured data) and the joint uncertainty $j_h$ (`NEE_VUT_REF_JOINTUNC`),
  defined by ONEFlux as $j_h^2 = r_h^2 + \big((\mathrm{NEE}_{84,h} -
  \mathrm{NEE}_{16,h}) / 2\big)^2$, the second term the spread of NEE across
  the ensemble of u\* thresholds. Their difference is the u\*-filtering part,
  $u_h = \sqrt{\max(j_h^2 - r_h^2, 0)}$. For a window,

  $$
  \big(\sigma^{\mathrm{obs}}_W\big)^2 = \frac{1}{n_W} \, \overline{r^2}_W + \big(\bar{u}_W\big)^2,
  $$

  where $\overline{r^2}_W$ and $\bar u_W$ are the means over the hours of $W$
  that report them. The random part is independent from hour to hour, so it
  averages down with $n_W$; the u\* part shifts every hour of a window
  together, so it does not. Where some hours report no uncertainty, the mean
  over those that do stands for all twelve.
- **MODIS LAI.** $\sigma_i$ is the product's `LaiStdDev_500m` (times its 0.1
  scale factor). The retrieval finds every canopy its radiative transfer
  model accepts as consistent with the observed reflectances; $y_i$ is their
  mean LAI and $\sigma_i$ their standard deviation, which the MOD15 user guide
  (V6.1) calls "a measure of the solution accuracy". It is a spread among
  solutions, not a comparison with ground measurements.
- **LandTrendr.** $\sigma_j$ is the raw file's `agb_sd`, which for 2012-2017
  `data/README.md` records as LandTrendr's own; what it quantifies is not
  documented in the file.
- **SoilGrids.** $\sigma$ is the raw file's `sd`, carried with the value
  through the assembly; how it was derived from SoilGrids is not recorded.

### Noise model (proposed, not yet implemented)

$R$ is fixed, not a function of $\theta$, so that MCMC and EKI target the same
posterior, and block-diagonal over the sources, no two sources' errors
correlated:

$$
R = \operatorname{diag}(R_1, \dots, R_K), \qquad R_k = \Sigma^{\mathrm{obs}}_k + \Sigma^{\delta}_k .
$$

$\Sigma^{\mathrm{obs}}_k$ is built from the measurement errors above;
$\Sigma^{\delta}_k$ is model discrepancy and representation error, how far a
point SIPNET can be from the observed quantity at the best $\theta$. The log
likelihood is

$$
\log p(y \mid \theta) = -\tfrac12 \big(y - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{M}(\theta))\big)^{\!\top} R^{-1} \big(y - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{M}(\theta))\big) - \tfrac12 \log\det R - \tfrac{N}{2} \log 2\pi,
$$

scored as `pyeki.gauss.Gaussian(y, DensePSD(R)).log_density`, with $R$
factored once; a failed run scores $-\infty$. The temporal correlation below is
$c_\tau(t, t') = \exp(-|t - t'| / \tau)$, with $t$ in days.

- **NEE**, for each of the two sources separately, the two independent:

  $$
  R_{WW'} = \big(\sigma^{\mathrm{obs}}_W\big)^2 \mathbf{1}[W = W'] + \sigma_\delta^2 \, c_\tau(w^+, w'^+),
  $$

  with $\sigma_\delta = 1.0$ µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ for `nee_night_centered` and $1.8$
  for `nee_day_centered`, and $\tau = 2$ days. $\sigma_\delta$ is 0.7 times the
  standard deviation of the observed windows' anomalies from their seasonal
  cycle (1.43 and 2.55), that is, SIPNET assumed to explain about half the
  day-to-day variance; $\tau$ gives a correlation of 0.61 between consecutive
  days, where the observed anomalies' is 0.45-0.50.
- **MODIS LAI**:

  $$
  R_{ii'} = \max(\sigma_i, 0.66)^2 \, \mathbf{1}[i = i'] + \sigma_\delta^2 \, c_{\tau}(t_i, t_{i'}) \, \mathbf{1}[\mathrm{year}(t_i) = \mathrm{year}(t_{i'})],
  $$

  with $\sigma_\delta = 0.5$ m² m⁻² and $\tau = 30$ days: correlated within a
  summer, independent across summers. The 0.66 floor is the reanalysis's
  (`data/README.md` open question 22).
- **LandTrendr**, with $\sigma = (\sigma_j)_j$ and $y = (y_j)_j$ as vectors:

  $$
  R = \sigma \sigma^{\top} + \kappa^2 \, y y^{\top} + \sigma_\delta^2 I,
  \qquad \kappa = \frac{0.02}{0.48},\ \sigma_\delta = 5\ \mathrm{Mg\,ha^{-1}}.
  $$

  The first term is LandTrendr's error, taken as shared by every year, since
  its trajectories are fitted per pixel; the second is the carbon fraction's
  uncertainty, the IPCC range 0.46-0.50 about 0.48, also shared; the third is
  independent year-to-year discrepancy.
- **SoilGrids**: $R = \sigma^2 + (0.25\, y)^2$, the second term for the depth
  and definition SIPNET's single soil pool does not share with a 0-200 cm
  stock (`data/README.md` open question 21).

## Decisions

Each records what was chosen and why, so a result can be read against it.

- **The site** is 4977, Harvard Forest, where two AmeriFlux towers stand:
  US-Ha1 (hourly) and the NEON tower US-xHA (half-hourly).
- **One driver member**, so that the forward model is deterministic, as the
  MCMC comparison needs.
- **The driver file is corrected before any run**, so that every row means
  what SIPNET's format says: labeled with the UTC start of its three-hour
  step, and every value a total or a mean over that step. The four
  corrections, in `prepare_drivers.py`: the drifting hour labels are rebuilt
  from position (`data/README.md` Note 15); every label moves back three hours,
  since radiation and precipitation cover the three hours *ending* at the
  label (Note 16); the snapshot columns (temperature, humidity, wind) become
  the mean of their two edge values (Note 16); and soil temperature, which
  PEcAn built with a filter that averages the *following* weeks of air
  temperature, is recomputed with the same filter run forward in time. The
  model's time axis is then UTC, the observed NEE's clock.
- **NEE: US-Ha1 to calibrate, US-xHA to check.** US-Ha1 covers nine years of
  the drivers' record, US-xHA six, so the longer record calibrates. US-xHA's
  years after US-Ha1's record ends are then an out-of-sample check, by a tower
  whose footprint the calibration never saw; how much the two towers disagree
  where they overlap is a measure of how well one tower stands for the site.
- **NEE: the u\* threshold estimated per year** (`NEE_VUT_REF`), over one
  threshold for the whole record. The two differ little at this site; the
  per-year series exists at more of the pool's sites, so the choice carries
  over to a multi-site calibration.
- **SMAP soil moisture is left out.** The reason is
  `config.EXCLUDED_CONSTRAINTS`: SMAP L4's total-profile volumetric water
  content has no defensible counterpart in SIPNET's bucket, and the
  reanalysis's comparison, with the bucket's fraction of capacity, compares a
  volumetric content with a degree of saturation.
- **NEE is averaged over two twelve-hour windows a day**, 00-12 and 12-24 UTC
  (night- and day-centered at Harvard Forest), each an observation only when
  at least half its values were measured rather than gap-filled. A whole day
  would need both halves measured, which keeps almost no summer days, since
  calm summer nights fail the u\* filter, and biases the kept days toward
  less uptake. The model is reduced over the same windows, whose edges are
  its timestep edges, as a mean rate.
- **LandTrendr is dry biomass, 2012-2017 only.** Its spec records carbon, but
  at the site it is about twice the initial conditions' aboveground carbon
  map, so the model's wood carbon is divided by a carbon fraction of 0.48.
  From 2018 its uncertainties come from a separate model and change with its
  values (`data/README.md` open question 19).
- **GEDI is left out**: its units are not established, and its three values
  at the site disagree with each other and with LandTrendr
  (`config.EXCLUDED_CONSTRAINTS`).
