"""Base classes for structured linear operators.

An operator represents a matrix implicitly, by how it acts on vectors, so that
known structure can be exploited instead of storing or factorizing a dense
array. Concrete operators live in :mod:`.leaves` and :mod:`.composite`.

Class hierarchy
---------------
Each level adds the operations that become well defined at that level.

``LinOp``
    Any linear map, possibly rectangular.
    Provides ``matvec``, ``matmat``, ``to_dense``.
``SquareLinOp``
    A square map.
    Adds ``solve``, ``solve_mat``, ``logdet``, ``diag``.
``PSDOperator``
    A symmetric positive semi-definite map.
    Adds ``factor``, ``cholesky``, ``whiten``.

Array shapes
------------
Every method takes leading batch axes; the operand's core shape is trailing.

==============  ====================  ====================================
method          core operand          signature
==============  ====================  ====================================
``matvec``      vector ``(n_in,)``    ``(..., n_in) -> (..., n_out)``
``matmat``      matrix ``(n_in, k)``  ``(..., n_in, k) -> (..., n_out, k)``
``solve``       vector ``(n,)``       ``(..., n) -> (..., n)``
``solve_mat``   matrix ``(n, k)``     ``(..., n, k) -> (..., n, k)``
==============  ====================  ====================================

The ``k`` in ``matmat`` is part of the core shape, not a batch axis. Use
``matvec`` for a batch of vectors and ``matmat`` for a single matrix operand;
neither infers which you meant from the number of dimensions.

Unsupported operations
----------------------
Not every operator can do everything cheaply. An operator raises
:class:`UnsupportedOp` rather than falling back to dense linear algebra. Query
support with ``op.supports(name)`` or ``op.capabilities()``, and use
:func:`densify` when a dense fallback is genuinely wanted.

Defining a new operator
-----------------------
Subclass the appropriate level, decorate with :func:`operator`, and implement
``shape``, ``matvec``, ``to_dense``, plus whichever optional methods the
structure supports. Use :func:`dense_matvec` and :func:`tri_solve` for the
array work so the shape convention above is honoured. Mark non-array fields
with :func:`static_field`. Validate against
:func:`sipnet_calibration.linalg.testing.check_operator`.

Notes
-----
Design decisions behind the above, recorded because they are not obvious and
are easy to undo by accident:

- The hierarchy has three levels rather than two because ``factor()`` returns
  a square root *as an operator*, and square roots are generally rectangular
  and not self-adjoint. Keeping them in ``LinOp`` means they cannot expose a
  ``solve`` that has no meaning.
- Implementations must contract the *trailing* axis. Writing ``self.M @ x``
  instead contracts the second-to-last axis once ``x`` has two or more
  dimensions, which returns a wrong answer without raising whenever the
  operator is square.
- ``to_dense`` is built from stored arrays rather than by applying the
  operator to an identity matrix. The test suite compares ``matvec`` against
  ``to_dense``, so an implementation via ``matvec`` would make that check
  vacuous.
- Unsupported operations raise instead of densifying so that an accidental
  O(n^3) cost is visible rather than silent.
